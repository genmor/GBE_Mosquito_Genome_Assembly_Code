Run these scripts in order.

Before running, prepare the directory structure.
0_original contains gff files that contains all isoforms
fna contains nucleotide fastas
ensure that the gffs and fastas have matching names!

Description of each script:

1. subset the gffs to include only the longest isoforms
2. extract amino acid sequences using the gffs from step 1 and the fastas
3. remove stop codons
4. simplifies the fasta headers 

The amino acid fastas output from step 4 should be used for analysis.
